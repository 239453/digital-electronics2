# Lab 2: Control of GPIO, LED, push button


### Learning objectives

The purpose of this laboratory exercise is to learn how to use basic input/output devices push buttons and LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes), and how to control a GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) pin with help of control registers.



## Preparation tasks (done before the lab at home)

## Part 1: Synchronize Git and create a new folder

When you start working, always synchronize the contents of your working folder and local repository with remote version at GitHub. This way you are sure that you will not lose any of your changes.

Run Git Bash (Windows) of Terminal (Linux) and synchronize repositories.

```bash
## Windows Git Bash:
$ cd d:/Documents/
$ cd your-name/
$ cd Digital-electronics-2/
$ git pull

## Linux:
$ cd
$ cd Documents/
$ cd your-name/
$ cd Digital-electronics-2/
$ git pull
```

Create a new working folder `Labs/02-leds` for this exercise.

```bash
## Windows Git Bash or Linux:
$ cd Labs/
$ mkdir 02-leds
```


## Part 2: Active-low and active-high LEDs

AVR microcontroller associates pins into so-called ports, which are marked with the letters A, B, C, etc. Each of the pins is controlled separately and can function as an input (entry) or output (exit) point of the microcontroller. Control is possible exclusively by software via control registers.

There are exactly three control registers for each port: DDR, PORT and PIN, supplemented by the letter designation of the port. For port B these are registers DDRB, PORTB and PINB, for port A registers DDRA, PORTA, PINA, etc.

DDR (Data Direction Register) is used to set the input/output direction of port communication, PORT is the output data port and PIN works for reading input values from the port.

A detailed description of working with input/output ports can be found in [ATmega328P datasheet](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATmega328p) in section I/O-Ports.

Use the datasheet to find out the meaning of the DDRB and PORTB control register values and their combinations.

| **DDRB** | **Description** |
| :-: | :-- |
| 0 | Input pin |
| 1 | |

| **PORTB** | **Description** |
| :-: | :-- |
| 0 | Output low value |
| 1 | |

| **DDRB** | **PORTB** | **Direction** | **Internal pull-up resistor** | **Description** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 0 | 0 | input | no | Tri-state, high-impedance |
| 0 | 1 | | | |
| 1 | 0 | | | |
| 1 | 1 | | | |

See [schematic of Arduino Uno board](../../Docs/arduino_shield.pdf) in docs folder of Digital-electronics-2 repository and find out which pins of ATmega328P can be used as input/output pins. To which pin is the LED L connected? Is it connected as active-low or active-high?

| **Port** | **Pin** | **Input/output usage?** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| A | x | Microcontroller ATmega328P does not contain port A |
| B | 0 | Yes (Arduino pin 8) |
|   | 1 |  |
|   | 2 |  |
|   | 3 |  |
|   | 4 |  |
|   | 5 |  |
|   | 6 |  |
|   | 7 |  |
| C | 0 | Yes (Arduino pin A0) |
|   | 1 |  |
|   | 2 |  |
|   | 3 |  |
|   | 4 |  |
|   | 5 |  |
|   | 6 |  |
|   | 7 |  |
| D | 0 | Yes (Arduino pin RX<-0) |
|   | 1 |  |
|   | 2 |  |
|   | 3 |  |
|   | 4 |  |
|   | 5 |  |
|   | 6 |  |
|   | 7 |  |

Use breadboard (or SimulIDE real time electronic circuit simulator), connect resistor and second LED to Arduino output pin in active-low way. **Restriction: use other than port B!**


### Version: Windows and Atmel Studio 7

Create a new project for ATmega328P within `02-leds` working folder and copy/paste [template code](main.c) to your `main.c` source file.

Complete the control register settings according to the pin to which you have connected the second LED. Program an application that blinks alternately with a pair of LEDs. Use the delay library as in the previous exercise.

Compile the project. Simulate the project in Atmel Studio 7.

Run external programmer in menu **Tools > Send to Arduino UNO** and download the compiled code to Arduino Uno board or load `*.hex` firmware to SimulIDE circuit.


### Version: Command-line toolchain

Copy `main.c` and `Makefile` files from previous lab to `Labs/02-leds` folder. Check if `firmware.in` settings file exists in `Labs` folder.

Copy/paste [template code](main.c) to your `main.c` source file.

Complete the control register settings according to the pin to which you have connected the second LED. Program an application that blinks alternately with a pair of LEDs. Use the delay library as in the previous exercise.

Compile the project with the `mingw32-make.exe all` (Windows) or `make all` (Linux).

Download the compiled code to Arduino Uno board with `mingw32-make.exe flash` (Windows) or `make flash` (Linux) or load `*.hex` firmware to SimulIDE circuit.












## Part 3: Push button

1. Use breadboard, connect push button to Arduino input pin and program an application that toggles the LEDs each time the push button is pressed. Use the [AVR Libc library macros](https://www.microchip.com/webdoc/AVRLibcReferenceManual/ch20s22s02.html) to test bit values in control register:

    ```C
    if (bit_is_set(PINA, 0)) {...}      // Only if PINA bit number 0 is 1 (set)
    if (bit_is_clear(PINB, 5)) {...}    // Only if PINB bit number 5 is 0 (clear)
    loop_until_bit_is_set(PINC, 2);     // Stay here until PINC2 bit becomes 1
    loop_until_bit_is_clear(PINA, 7);   // Stay here until PINA7 bit becomes 0
    ```


## Switch debouncing

*[Bouncing](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/debouncing) is the tendency of any two metal contacts in an electronic device to generate multiple signals as the contacts close or open; debouncing is any kind of hardware device or software that ensures that only a single signal will be acted upon for a single opening or closing of a contact.*

![debouncing](Images/debouncer.png "Sampled push button signal")

1. Use AVR Libc and time delay library functions to debounce a push button. Create an application that samples the input signal and decides that the push button was pressed based on a series of the same values, eg. four zero bits consecutively present on the input pin.












## Clean project and synchronize git

Use [git commands](https://github.com/tomas-fryza/Digital-electronics-2/wiki/Git-useful-commands) to add, commit, and push all local changes to your remote repository. Check the repository at GitHub web page for changes.


## Experiments on your own

1. Connect five LEDs to the microcontroller, modify `02-leds` code, and program an application that will ensure that only one of LED is switched on at a time according in [Knight Rider style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-P-2LdS6zk).

2. Simulate the Knight Rider application in SimulIDE.

3. Program the [PWM generator](https://www.analogictips.com/pulse-width-modulation-pwm/) using the delay library. Let the duty cycle of the PWM signal be changed continuously and the signal is connected to one of the LEDs. How does a change of duty cycle affect the brightness of an LED?
