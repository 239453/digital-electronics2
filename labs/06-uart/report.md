# Lab 6: INSERT_YOUR_FIRSTNAME INSERT_YOUR_LASTNAME

### UART communication

1. Draw timing diagram of the output from UART/USART when transmitting three character data `De2` in 4800 7O2 mode (7 data bits, odd parity, 2 stop bits, 4800&nbsp;Bd). The image can be drawn on a computer or by hand. Name all parts timing diagram.

2. Draw a flowchart for function `uint8_t get_parity(uint8_t data, uint8_t type)` which calculates a parity bit of input 8-bit `data` according to parameter `type`. The image can be drawn on a computer or by hand. Use clear descriptions of individual algorithm steps.
